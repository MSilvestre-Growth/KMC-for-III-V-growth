This is where you implement physics. The rate function in the CustomRateCalculator
allows you to set probabilities of each events defined in custom_processes.py
- In first time you set physical constants such as energies, atomic flux and
temperature.
- In a second time, you take neigbors into acount, which affect event's 
probabilities and allows you to avoid some events when the local configuration 
does not allow them.
- In a third time, you explicitly write the event probability (most often it is
based on Boltzman's law)
- The last thing you need to set up is the number of simulation steps and how
often you save a configuration in custom_traj.py

WARNING : the highest step is considered to be the highest on the wafer,
there is no stepflow above it
